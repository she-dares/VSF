## Before you begin...

**Add your Travis and Code Climate badges** to the
top of this README, using the markdown template for your master branch.

### Document code and read documentation

For some problems we have provided starter code. Please look carefully at the
doc strings and follow all input and output specifications.

For other problems, we might ask you to create new functions, please document
them using doc strings! Documentation factors into the "python quality" portion
of your grade.

***DO NOT*** commit this file to the repo (it's already in your
[.gitignore](.gitignore))

Both docker and pipenv will automatically inject these variables into your
environment!  Whenever you need new env variables, add them to a dotenv.

See env refs for
[docker](https://docs.docker.com/compose/environment-variables/) and
[pipenv](https://pipenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/advanced/#automatic-loading-of-env)
for more details.
